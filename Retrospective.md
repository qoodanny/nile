	In Iteration 2, we encountered a number of problems that needed to be worked on. 
	These problems have solutions that could have been prevented with more communications. 
	These problems include general communication, time management, and organization.

	The first problem was our communication. The greatest problem with our communication was that
	a member of the group was in the process of dropping the course without informing the group. 
	This resulted in code that was expected to be completed not being finished. This is being 
	fixed by having guaranteed weekly meetings, more if necessary, to talk and discuss the 
	current state of our responsibilities. This way we can have an understanding on what is 
	being done and what may need more time. This final Iteration also has a lot more teamwork 
	needed, as people will need to communicate about their code to ensure safe and reliable 
	new code being added. This can be worked on in class or before/after our weekly meetings.

	The second problem is time management. With iteration 2 we did not consider the time 
	for issues with code as well as the time for merging all the code verifying each work. 
	This became a large problem with the merging process causing rush work cutting close 
	to the deadline. This iteration we will do a merge after each week to ensure all code 
	is working, as well as with our team meetings to talk with each member on if they are 
	handling their workload well. 

	The third problem is with our team's organization. With iteration 0, and iteration 1 
	we managed without worry due to not being as complex. But in Iteration 2, the stakes 
	were much higher and the organization of what needs to be done, what has been done, 
	what can we get done was not managed properly. To solve this problem in Iteration 3 
	we have set up a week by week schedule we plan to stick to. This way we can keep track 
	of the progress and what is done very easily. Making sure to give enough time for code, 
	as well as for testing. And giving enough leeway for problems each week. The leeway can 
	be used to solve problems or as time to get ahead depending on the person's time schedule. 
	As well as leeway for the weeks, we also are leaving 4 days at the end of the iteration for 
	emergencies. These 4 days are to ensure that in the event of error in the final product, we 
	will have all hands on deck prepared to assist with it. 

	These are the general problems that were associated with our Iteration 2. The solutions we 
	have found should assist us with our Iteration 3, as we have already taken them into account 
	with our planning. Using our flaws from previous Iterations, we can ensure a great Iteration 
	3.
